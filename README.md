# Welcome to PrepNXT

PrepNXT is working on an open-source, community-driven handbook, the so-called PrepNXT Brain. A collaboration to get to a universal outdoors, survival, preparedness reference guide optimized for people living in Europe.

## Why now PrepNXT?

The idea for PrepNXT started in the beginning of 2020. COVID-19 is rapidly accelerating from Asia to Europe and North-America and having a real impact on the day to day live of people. In this time, there is an information overload, but what is fact and what is fiction? And does all advice apply to me? We noticed a lack of a clear, non-alarmist resource, that is easy to digest (no pay-wall, no advertising) and applies to Europeans with different attitude, laws & regulations than Americans that seem to be the target of most outdoors, survival, and prepping advice.
